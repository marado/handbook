title: "Who and how can I contribute"
---

Everyone can contribute. There are no special requirements. Even if you are not a so-called power-user, you can learn and develop skills to independently work on new datapackages. And, more importantly, we try to cover everything you need to get started!

The recommendation is to read the Data Guides first, which will help you get used to some of the concepts and technologies we use.
Next, you will be ready to get involved with the community and this guide will help you get on your feet.
