title: "Key Principles"
---

Underlynig the core datasets projects, there are a couple of principles that are key to understanding how we do things 
and why we do it.

Narrow Focus
----------------

   Focus on Reference & Indicator data. We are not building something for all data or even most data.

Small
-------

   Max 100.000-500.000 rows. Prefer several separate slices to one huge dataset.

Tabular
--------

   All data should have Tabular form and serialized as CSV. 1 record to 1 row a unique id.

Well Structured
----------

   No blank lines at the top of the table, no footnotes inline in rows at the bottom.

Key Additional Information
---------

   Simple, but sufficient, basic metadata (what, where, from, what license) plus data structure info (e.g. fields and their types)

Host it on GitHub
----------

   So that everyone can participate too!
