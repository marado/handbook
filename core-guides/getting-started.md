title: "Getting started"
---

As mentioned before, this is the place to start if you are interested in participating the Core Datasets project.

The first and immediate thing you should do is to sign-up in the [forum](https://discuss.okfn.org/) and introduce yourself.
The forums act as our central place of communications. However, we also discuss a lot through GitHub, since we keep track 
of our project's management through the [issues tab](https://github.com/datasets/registry/issues).

[This video](https://vimeo.com/133587259) will help you understand the core functionalities of the platform where we host 
the forums. Worry not!, you will find most of them very intuitive and will learn along the way. In fact, feel free to ask for 
help in there if you feel lost.

In order to keep things organized in GitHub, we use the label system. They are very straightforward and easy to understand. 
It is important that you respect those, that are usually attributed by Core Datasets Managers. This group of people keeps 
track of the project's needs and tries to forward the project's direction accordingly.

The label system also helps users to know where to contribute immediately. 

## How to read labels

The label tabs have been named in a very intuitively way, thinking about others that could come along and wanting to contribute.

You can find difficulty levels - usually associated with how hard can it be to get the data from the source - or if someone 
already dealt with downloading and preparing the data, only remaining to prepare the package. There are other indicators too, 
like `Indicator`, `format`, among others. However, the most crucial one is actually the priority of that dataset.


At this point, you should have learned how the community is structured and how you can contribute to the Core Datasets Project.

The next couple of tutorials will be slightly more technical to explain how you can prepare a data package and what you should 
pay attention to.
